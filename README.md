# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
In this analysis we creaed a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Additionally a multiple-line graph that demonstrating the total weekly fares for each city type was created. Using the  data we can see how ride-sharing differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results: 
- As expected the number of rides and the total numbers of drivers were lower in the rural areas
- The urban market is the most profitable city type
- A summary can be found here:

- There was a peak in all markets in late February
- The urban market was the most profitable in January 2019 to April 2019
- A summary of the weekly data can be found here:

## Summary: 
Based on the results, I recommend that (1) the number of drivers be increased in rural areas, (2) decrease the fare rate in rural areas to increase number of rides (3) increase the number of drivers in all markets in late Februrary.
